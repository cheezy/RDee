#
# RDee was designed to make it easy for your tests to switch between different browsers.  It
# can select browsers that are running on your local machine or on a Selenium Grid.  The way
# you select a browser is by calling one of the following methods:
#
# @example Calling the RDee methods
#   RDee.selenium_browser(target = :firefox, options = {})
#   # or
#   RDee.watir_browser(target = :firefox, options = {})
#
#
# These methods take two optional parameters.  The first is the target browser.  The second
# is options that can be passed to that browser when it is started.
#
# You can specify the target browser by passing a symbol
# to the `selenium_browser` or `watir_browser` methods.  The problem with this is that you
# would have to change the code if you wanted to use a different browser.  RDee has made
# this simpler by allowing you to set the target browser using an environment variable.
# The environment variable is named `RDEE_BROWSER`.  A couple of typical usage patterns
# are to set this in the `cucumber.yml` file for specific profiles or to simply set this
# on the command-line when running the tests.  Here is an example of a `cucumber.yml` file:
#
# @example  Setting RDEE_BROWSer environment variable in cucumber.yml
#   default: RDEE_BROWSER=firefox --format pretty --color
#   chrome: RDEE_BROWSER=chrome --format pretty --color
#   safari: RDEE_BROWSER=safari --format pretty --color
#
# From the command-line you could simply do this:
#
# @example Setting the RDEE_BROWSER environment variable from command-line
#   RDEE_BROWSER=chrome bundle exec cucumber
#
# The format of the target passed to the methods or set in the environment variable determines
# what browser, version, and host os you get.  The format follows the following pattern:
#
# @example Format of the target browser
#   firefox30_win8
#
#
# The first part of the target determines what browser to use.  At the current time you can
# specify `firefox`, `chrome`, `ie`, or `safari`.  In the near future we will be supporting
# mobile platforms so stay tuned.
#
# Immediately following the browser is the version.  This is optional and if you do not specify
# it will select whatever version is available.  It is up to you to make sure that the browser
# and version combination are valid.
#
# Following the version there is an underscore followed by the host os.  This value is also
# optional.  Currently the following host os values are available:
#
#   | host          | description |
#   | ------------- | ----------- |
#   | win81         | Windows 8.1 |
#   | win8          | Windows 8   |
#   | win7          | Windows 7   |
#   | winxp         | Windows XP  |
#   | snow_leopard  | OS X 10.6   |
#   | mountain_lion | OS X 10.8   |
#   | mavricks      | OS X 10.9   |
#   | yosemite      | OS X 10.10  |
#   | el_capitan    | OS X 10.11  |
#   | linux         | Linux       |
#
# The host os value is typically used when running the tests on a Selenium Grid.  It is up to
# you to ensure that the host and requested browser combination exist on your grid.
#
# Additional parameters can be set by calling the configure method on the RDee module.  First
# of all, you can set the `url` value.  If the `url` is set RDee will attempt to make a remote
# connect to the grid specified by the `url`.  Additionaly you can specify whether it should
# use a persistent http connection as well as specify additional parameters that should be
# sent to a specific type of browser when it is used.  Here are examples:
#
# @example Setting parameters using configure
#   RDee.configure do | config |
#     config.url = 'http://path.to.selenium.grid/wd/hub'
#     config.persistent_http = true
#     config.chrome_options = { :switches => %w[--disable-extensions]}
#     config.firefox_options = { :switches => %w[--disable-popups]}
#     config.ie_options = { :switches => %w[--disable-popups]}
#     config.safari_options = { :switches => %w[--disable-popups]}
#   end
#
